# TTS Dataset Maker
**Make your own text to speech dataset with this tool.
Why should you make one? To replicate people's voices kinda like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK_iYBl8cA&t=19s) and much more.**
<br/>
**Fair Warning: It's way harder than you think and this will make it a little less harder**
